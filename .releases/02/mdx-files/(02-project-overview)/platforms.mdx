## Front-end

Based on possibilities of React Native, we can build applications for iOS, **Android**, and **Web**. Due to limitation of non-using and negative experience about iOS/iPhones we are not sure about shipping iOS build.

So primary we are focusing on stable Android and Web builds, with optional iOS.

## Back-end

The back-end is built on Elysia, which is a TypeScript framework supercharged by Bun. With possibilities of Bun - it can be built to binary and run on every machine.

Primary, production target is **Linux**, and developing include **Windows**.
