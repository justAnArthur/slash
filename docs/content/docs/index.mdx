title: Introduction
description: Cross-platform application JUST for messaging.
---

Chat – a simple word for a simple app. No nuclear collider of pointless, useless features here. As a developer who thinks WordPress is shit and would rather build something fresh from the ground several times, I wanted an app that’s as straightforward as its name.

C – Cross-platform:
I'm not a tech-giant to have time and money to batter with one button looking the same on different devices and platforms. So... we have choice: React-Native. That is not just a web-view (based on MTAA requirements), JS ❤️, and good, excellent, ecosystem.

H – Huge Performance:
I'm a programmer, and if my system doesn’t boot in a second, it’s bullshit. Sure, React Native might throw a wrench in the works sometimes, but in good hands and with a little clever tinkering it’s fast as hell (don't know why hell is fast). And on the backend, we’re using Bun to keep message sending lightning quick.

A – Atomicity:
When millions of messages are flying around, reliability is non-negotiable. With Bun and Elysia (plus their awesome plugins), every message is handled solidly, with logs and stats that actually mean something.

T – Touch-Friendly:
I don't like when mobile application are designed like I am using the phone with two hands. **I CANNOT CLICK ON LEFT TOP CORNER BUTTON**. That is even better on iphoneos that does not support gestures, and you need to touch in that corner several times.

So... Simple, Fast, Atomic, and (most importantly) Easy to use.
